# (def shef 36) More Neural Networks

We'll be looking at a neural network implementation to classify
handwritten digits, using a public dataset.

## The Dataset

We'll be using the derivative of
[MNIST dataset of handwritten digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
The original version of this dataset uses a proprietary binary format,
so a gzipped CSV version is provided in the resources directory of
this repository. (Credit to https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/)
